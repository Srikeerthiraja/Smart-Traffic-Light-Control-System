# Vehicle Detection Module 

###  Overview
This module is responsible for detecting and counting vehicles in real-time from a live camera feed using **OpenCV-Python**.  
The detection results are sent to the main control logic, which adjusts the traffic signal duration dynamically based on vehicle density.

---

###  Workflow
1. Capture video frames from a webcam or traffic camera feed.
2. Convert frames to grayscale and apply background subtraction.
3. Use contour detection to identify moving vehicles.
4. Count vehicles crossing a defined “detection line”.
5. Send the vehicle count to the main controller using a data file or serial communication.

###  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, time  
- **Output:** Vehicle count per lane (int)

###  Example (Simplified Pseudocode)
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Initialize camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
vehicle_count = 0

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)
    
    # Example background subtraction (simplified)
    _, thresh = cv2.threshold(blur, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    
    vehicle_count = len(contours)
    print("Detected Vehicles:", vehicle_count)
    
    # Send to controller (placeholder)
    # send_data(vehicle_count)
